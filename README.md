Hello! My name is Cal Walrath and these are some of the projects I have done. They are each described in detail inside their respective folders. They include:

- An investigation into bias in the Fandango movie rating display
- A project to determine the most helpful movie review website
- A script to automatically convert assessments of property lines (of any style) into a format readable by the software BS&A, requested by the Lapeer County Drainage Commission
- A Hamming code decipherer, using linear algebra concepts
