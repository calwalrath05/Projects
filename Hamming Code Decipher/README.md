I made this notebook for my linear algebra class project. One of the questions was to decipher a message given by a Hamming code. This code consisted of 52 characters, each represented by a 9-bit string. Each 9-bit string contained at most one corrupted bit, so my program uses the concept of Hamming distance to determine the intended message. The encoded message is stored in messageFall2024.csv
