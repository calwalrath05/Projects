The employees of the Lapeer County Drainage Commission asked for a program to automatically format legal assessments of property lines so that they can quickly import them into RS&A, a software that maps these lines. This project allows this to be done instantaneously for any number of files.

Before this program:
- The LCDC office needed to manually open a word document with the assessor's notes, identify and copy and paste each individual coordinate and distance description, and change small formatting discrepancies by hand.
- Over many files, this process takes many hours, even for a team of several people.
- This work is tedious, monotonous, and very time-consuming.

After this program:
- Any number of files can be instantaneously processed and formatted.
- Employees no longer need to worry about looming deadlines for this work.

How the program works:
- Parsing the relevant coordinate\distance data from a given assessment
- Removing extra information and unusual formatting practices
- Exporting the information into a new .txt document precisely formatted to specifications

Challenges:
- The most significant challenge in the implementation of this program (as well as for the workers) is that the style of documentation is extremely diverse between different asessors; there is no standard format for these legal documents.
- Due to the robust nature of the program, even a document as unusual and convoluted as legal3.txt can be processed to the same degree of accuracy as a human.

I am proud that this work saves hard-working government employees days of stress and effort!
